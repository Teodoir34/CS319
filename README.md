How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that what I create is functional and secure by properly noting code as I go, testing each use case to the requirements, and ensuring that I amply quality test as I continue to create. While I used mainly black and white box testing, as I gain experience I hope to implement experience based testing into my repertoire.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The best way to interpret needs - specifically for myself - is to take a look at each rule listed out, format them in  away that has logical flow, write the code to follow, and implement a testing process for each rule listed so that there is no mistaking not only what is needed but also that nothing is left out and each portion works fully and functions as intended.

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software should be approached with an open mind and a plan to implement and test along the way to ensure functionality while meeting what is required. It's important to note that simple items such as a character limit working appropriately may also prevent insertion attacks or other such hacking attempts and requirements should not be written off just because they seem like they are not important. Testing along the way means a reduction in workload overall and a strong and successful deliverable in the end that you can be proud of while aligning with ethics of a programmer!
